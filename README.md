# evaluation02

This dice game was developed for my graduate developer program at Digital Campus Live.
Requirements were to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Ionic Framework for a responsive game. The use of the Lato font was mandatory.
The game browser general layout was given in the evaluation statement.
These features were mandatory: being able to create a new game, to hold the current score, to throw the dice and two available players on the same screen.

Rules are as follow:
- during their turn, each player can throw the dice as many times as they want
- getting a 1 ends the player's turn, switches to the other
- each player can hold their current score, which switches to the other player
- goal is to reach a score of a 100
